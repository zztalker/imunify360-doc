# FAQ and Known Issues


## Common Questions

### 1. End user IP is blocked and I do not know why

If you use CSF, then try to find the IP in [CSF](/ids_integration/#csf-integration) <span class="notranslate">Allow/Deny</span> Lists using their [documentation and support](https://support.configserver.com/knowledgebase/category/support%20). If not, then do the following:

* Go to cPanel Plugins section, choose Imunify360 and enter the <span class="notranslate">Incidents</span> page.

* Make sure that the IP checkbox at the top of the table is ticked. Enter proper IP or part of IP in the input field and click _Enter_.

  * If the IP was found, then follow instructions on [Incidents page](/dashboard/#incidents) and perform the actions you need, like: add IP to the <span class="notranslate">White List</span> or disable the security rule that has detected this incident.

* If the IP was not found on the Incidents page, then go to Firewall page and using the same way as in the previous step try to find proper IP in <span class="notranslate">Black List</span> or <span class="notranslate">Grey List</span>.

  * If the IP was found then follow this instruction for <span class="notranslate">[Grey List](/dashboard/#firewall)</span> or <span class="notranslate">[Black List](/dashboard/#firewall)</span> and move the IP to the <span class="notranslate">White List</span> or just remove from the <span class="notranslate">Black List</span> or <span class="notranslate">Grey List</span>.

If nothing helps, then [contact our support team](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new).

### 2. Could I disable IPtables (firewall) or OSSEC, when using Imunify360?

No. Imunify360 will not be able to stop an attack without IPtables and will not be able to detect an attack without OSSEC.

### 3. Does Imunify360 log events such as adding or removing an IP to/from the Gray List?

Most Imunify360 logs are saved in <span class="notranslate">`/var/log/imunify360/console.log`</span>. For example, when IP is blocked and added to the <span class="notranslate">Black List</span>, the following lines are added:

<div class="notranslate">

``` Python
INFO [2017-04-15 18:30:00,889]

```

</div>

Adding and removing IPs from the <span class="notranslate">White List</span> is only possible manually, no IPs will be added automatically.

### 5. To start using Imunify360 we need to know which information is sent to your servers. Could you please give us some more information?

The following info is sent to our server:

* all the messages from IDS OSSEC (can be found in OSSEC logs)
* all the messages from <span class="notranslate">mod_security</span> (can be found in <span class="notranslate">`modsec_audit.log`</span>)
* users domains (to be checked in reputation engine);
* CAPTCHA verification info
* all running scans for malware (maldet scans) and information on moving to the quarantine or discovering suspicious files
* optionally, suspicious files can be sent to us for the analysis. Files can be sent via UI by marking a proper checkbox

### 6. No valid Imunify360 License Found.

Check if the agent is running.

Check access to the central server (<span class="notranslate">`IP: 148.251.130.176 port: 443)`</span>.

Call <span class="notranslate">`imunify360-agent rstatus`</span> and ensure that status is <span class="notranslate">`True`</span>:

<div class="notranslate">

```
{'expiration': 0, 'status': True, 'user_count': None, 'user_limit': None, 'redirect_url': None}
```

</div>

Ensure that <span class="notranslate">`/etc/sysconfig/imunify360/imunify360.id`</span> file contains <span class="notranslate">`server_id`</span>.

If no, <span class="notranslate">`imunify360-agent register KEY`</span>.

### 7. I have an error peewee.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed. What should I do?

Imunify360 uses SQLite database to store its data. Although this database has proved its reliability, database files become corrupted in rare cases. To restore data try to perform the following steps:

Stop the agent.

If you have sqlite3 application installed on your machine, try to make dump of Imunify360 database:

<div class="notranslate">

```
#sqlite3 /var/imunify360/imunify360.db
.mode insert
.output dump_all.sql
.dump
.exit
```

</div>

You should see new file <span class="notranslate">`dump_all.sql`</span> in the directory <span class="notranslate">`/var/imunify/`</span>

Create a new database from this dump file:

<div class="notranslate">

```
#sqlite3 imunify360.db.new < dump_all.sql
```

</div>

Replace old database with the new one:

<div class="notranslate">

```
#cd /var/imunify/
#mv imunify360.db imunify360.db.corrupt && mv imunify360.db.new imunify360.db
```

</div>

Start the Imunify360 agent.

If these steps have not solved the problem or no sqlite3 package is installed, then you should create a completely new database:

Stop the agent.

<div class="notranslate">

```
#rm /var/imunify/imunify360.db
#imunify360-agent migratedb
```

</div>

Start the agent

### 8. Why does my cPanel with LiteSpeed and OWASP ModSecurity rule set trigger 500 error on all web pages after installing Imunify360?

OWASP rule set may conflict with Imunify360 default rule set on a server running <span class="notranslate">LiteSpeed Web Server</span>. We recommend to turn off OWASP rule set prior to installing Imunify360.

Please find more FAQs in our [Knowledge Base](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/sections/115001538929-FAQ).

### 9. Disabling WAF rules for certain countries.

It is possible to disable some WAF rules for IPs that are resolved to be from some country (or other geographical entity).
To implement this, a customer should create his own modsecurity configuration file, and include it into the default modsecurity configuration. In case of cPanel, this can be done by creating <span class="notranslate">`/etc/apache2/conf.d/includes/countrywafrules.conf`</span> and adding it as an include to the <span class="notranslate">`/etc/apache2/conf.d/modsec/modsec2.cpanel.conf`</span>. Otherwise configuration files might be rewritten by Imunify360 rules update.

Example of contents of such config file:

<div class="notranslate">

```
SecGeoLookupDb /path/to/GeoLiteCity.dat 
# ModSecurity relies on the free geolocation databases (GeoLite City and GeoLite Country) that can be obtained from MaxMind http://www.maxmind.com. Currently ModSecurity only supports the legacy GeoIP format. Maxmind's newer GeoIP2 format is not yet currently supported.
So a customer need to download this IP database and locate somewhere.

# Lookup IP address 
SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@geoLookup" "phase:1,id:155,nolog,pass"

# Optionally block IP address for which geolocation failed
# SecRule &GEO "@eq 0" "phase:1,id:156,deny,msg:'Failed to lookup IP'"

# Skip rules 942100 and 942101 for GB country as example

SecRule GEO:COUNTRY_CODE "@streq GB" "phase:2,auditlog,id:157,pass,severity:2,\
ctl:ruleRemoveById=942100,\
ctl:ruleRemoveById=942101"
```
</div>

Make sure that you have replaced <span class="notranslate">`/path/to/GeoLiteCity.dat`</span> with the real path to the GeoLiteCity.dat file installed in your system.

Variable <span class="notranslate">`GEO`</span> is a collection populated by result of the last <span class="notranslate">`@geoLookup`</span> operator. The collection can be used to match geographical fields looked from an IP address or hostname.

:::tip Note
Available since ModSecurity 2.5.0.
:::

Fields:

* <span class="notranslate">`COUNTRY_CODE`</span>: two character country code. Example: `US`, `GB`, etc.  
* <span class="notranslate">`COUNTRY_CODE3`</span>: up to three character country code.  
* <span class="notranslate">`COUNTRY_NAME`</span>: full country name.  
* <span class="notranslate">`COUNTRY_CONTINENT`</span>: two character continent that the country is located. Example: `EU`. 
* <span class="notranslate">`REGION`</span>: two character region. For US, this is state. For Canada, providence, etc.  
* <span class="notranslate">`CITY`</span>: city name if supported by the database.  
* <span class="notranslate">`POSTAL_CODE`</span>: postal code if supported by the database.  
* <span class="notranslate">`LATITUDE`</span>: latitude if supported by the database.  
* <span class="notranslate">`LONGITUDE`</span>: longitude if supported by the database.  
* <span class="notranslate">`DMA_CODE`</span>: metropolitan area code if supported by the database. (US only)  
* <span class="notranslate">`AREA_CODE`</span>: phone system area code. (US only)  

### 10. How to clone Imnify360 configuration on another system?

The solution is available in [FAQ section](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022689394-How-to-Clone-Imunify360-Installation)

### 11. How to disable Support icon in the Imunify360 UI?

1. Go to <span class="notranslate">`/etc/sysconfig/imunify360/imunify360.config`</span>.
2. And set <span class="notranslate">`PERMISSIONS.support_form:`</span> option to <span class="notranslate">`false`</span>.

OR, **better**, run the following command:

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"PERMISSIONS": {"support_form": false}}'
```

### 12. How to hide the Ignore List tab for end users in the Imunify360 UI?

1. Go to <span class="notranslate">`/etc/sysconfig/imunify360/imunify360.config`</span>.
2. And set <span class="notranslate">`PERMISSIONS.user_ignore_list:`</span> option to <span class="notranslate">`false`</span>.

OR, **better**, run the following command:

```
imunify360-agent config update '{"PERMISSIONS": {"user_ignore_list": false}}'
```

### 13. How to delete malware scan results from Imunify360’s database?

Sometimes, you may need to delete all users’ scan results from the server. This should not be common practice, and we do not recommend doing it on a regular basis. But, if you do need to erase the results of all Imunify360 scans, you can find the instructions below.

1. First, you need to stop the agent:

<div class="notranslate">

```
systemctl stop imunify360
```
</div>

(on CentOS 7)
<div class="notranslate">

```
service imunify360 stop
```
</div>

(on CentOS 6, Ubuntu)

2. Connect to the Imunify360 database by running this command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
sqlite3 /var/imunify360/imunify360.db
```
</div>

3. Execute the following SQL commands:

:::danger IMPORTANT
This will remove all scan results from Imunify360!
:::

<div class="notranslate">

```
DELETE FROM malware_history;
DELETE FROM malware_hits;
DELETE FROM malware_scans;
DELETE FROM malware_user_infected;
```
</div>

4. Start the Imunify360 service:

<div class="notranslate">

```
systemctl start imunify360
```
</div>

(on CentOS 7)
<div class="notranslate">

```
service imunify360 start
```
</div>

(on CentOS 6, Ubuntu)

We don’t recommend cleaning the scan results for specific users, as it may cause inconsistencies in the <span class="notranslate"> `malware_scans` </span> table. But, in emergencies, you can do it with these SQL commands:

<div class="notranslate">

```
DELETE FROM malware_history WHERE file_onwer = <user>;
DELETE FROM malware_hits WHERE user = <user>;
DELETE FROM malware_user_infected WHERE user = <user>;
```
</div>

Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to delete records in the <span class="notranslate"> `malware_scans` </span> table for a specific user, so the table should be either truncated with the other tables shown in step 2 above, or the records should just be ignored.

If you need any more information on this or anything else related to Imunify360 administration, please [get in touch](mailto:feedback@imunify360.com) .

### 14. Imunify360 WebShield ‘Could not allocate memory’ problem. How to fix?

**Symptoms:** It can have pretty different symptoms (increased IO, CPU and memory usage), but the main one is that WebShield blacklisting (through CDN) does not work.

**How to check:** Just browse wsshdict log (<span class="notranslate">`/var/log/wsshdict/wsshdict.log`</span>). If you face the issue, the log will have entries like:

<div class="notranslate">

```
2019-07-09 16:50:06 [WARN]: Could not allocate memory for 192.126.123.115/32 in rbtree
2019-07-09 16:52:23 [WARN]: Could not allocate memory for 179.108.244.125/32 in lpctrie
```

</div>

This means that the shared memory is full and no new address is allowed to be added.
Shared memory has a fixed size (it’s set in configuration files) and cannot change it dynamically. Currently, the size of shared memory is **20 MB**, and it can take up to 89k IPv4 addresses. However, some of our clients have more blacklisted addresses, and when Imunify360 agent tries to place all these IP addresses into shared memory, the aforementioned error occurs.

**How to fix:** We want to increase the shared memory size.

1. Modify the second parameter of the <span class="notranslate">`shared_storage`</span> directive of the <span class="notranslate">`/etc/imunify360-webshield/webshield.conf`</span> config file, to make it look like:

<div class="notranslate">

```
shared_storage /opt/imunify360-webshield/shared_data/shdict.dat 21m;
```

</div>

2. Modify the <span class="notranslate">`data_size`</span> directive of the <span class="notranslate">`/etc/imunify360-webshield/webshield-shdict.conf`</span> config file to `22020096` (21 MB in bytes: 1024 * 1024 * 21):

3. Restart <span class="notranslate">`imunify360-webshield`</span>:

<div class="notranslate">

```
   systemctl restart imunify360-webshield
```
</div>

Or

<div class="notranslate">
 
```
   service imunify360-webshield reload
```
 
 </div>
 
 The wsshdict daemon is expected to be restarted automatically.
 
4. Make sure the shared memory size is actually changed. Run <span class="notranslate">`ipcs -m`</span> command. It’s expected to have the output like this:

<div class="notranslate">
 
``` 
# ipcs -m
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key      shmid   owner    perms   bytes nattch status  
0x620035c1 4554752  imunify360 600    22020096   4                       
0x00000000 32769    root       644    80         2
``` 
 
</div>

The first column must not have zeros (like in the second row), the third column (owner) is expected to be ‘imunify360-webshield’, and size must correspond to values set in the config files (22020096 in our case).


### 15. How to check "ModSecurity scan" works?

1. To verify, if ModSecurity scan works, you can use the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
curl -v -s -o /dev/null -F 'data=@<path-to-malware-sample>' http://<domain>/
```

</div>

You can get a malware sample file on the eicar.org: [eicar.org](http://www.eicar.org/).

For instance:

<div class="notranslate">

```
wget http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt -O /tmp/eicar.com.txt
curl -v -s -o /dev/null -F 'data=@/tmp/eicar.com.txt' http://mycoolwebsite.net/
```
</div>

You can find the results of this attempt in the <span class="notranslate">_Incidents_</span> tab 

1. Also, you can perform the following request which triggers a test rule

<div class="notranslate">

```
curl -v http://mycoolwebsite.net//?i360test=88ff0adf94a190b9d1311c8b50fe2891c85af732 
```
</div>

And check the Imunify360 console log

<div class="notranslate">

```
grep 'Testing the work of the i360 ModSecurity rules' /var/log/imunify360/console.log
```
</div>

### 16. How to check "automatically scan all modified files" works?

To check "automatically scan all modified files" (i.e inotify scanner), upload a malware sample to some account's webroot via SSH and check if it will appear in the <span class="notranslate">_Malicious_</span> tab shortly.

You can get a malware sample file on the [eicar.org](http://www.eicar.org/).

Make sure [the option is enabled](/dashboard/#malware).

<div class="notranslate">

```
wget http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt -O /tmp/eicar.com.txt
scp /tmp/eicar.com.txt  mycooluser@X.Y.Z.A:/var/www/mycooluser/mycoolwebsite_docroot
```

</div>

where <span class="notranslate">`X.Y.Z.A`</span> - your server IP address

You can find the results in the <span class="notranslate">_Malware scanner > Files_</span> tab.
